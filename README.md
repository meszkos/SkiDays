# SkiDays

SkiDays is a still works but the final goal is to create an app for Alpine Skiers that they can use to upload and track their days on snow.
User will be able to add Training, notes, video and more. 

App is written in SwiftUI
I'm using Firebase for authentication and data storage.
I'm using SwiftLint for clean code standards.
Please be aware that in order to run this project locally, you need to create your own Firebase API key.
